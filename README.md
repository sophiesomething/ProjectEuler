# ProjectEuler

My solutions to the Project Euler exercises.

These are not necessarily elegant or efficient solutions... they are just the ones I have come up with. I am not a mathematician, but am using Project Euler in an attempt to learn Java. :-)

In the spirit of Project Euler, please attempt your own solutions rather than copying these!
